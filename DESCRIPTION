Description: The R version of the wind risk model ForestGALES. It contains
    both the traditional roughness method (for stand-level calculations), and
    the 'turning moment coefficient' version (for single-tree calculations).
    Wrapper functions exist for both methods to calculate the critical wind
    speeds of damage for stem breakage and tree uprooting. Probabilities of
    damage can be calculated when information on the local wind climate is
    known. The package includes model parametrisation for 23 tree species 
    (19 conifers and 4 broadleaves). Users can override most parameters for 
    available species, or introduce new species by providing new parameters
    values. Functions are available to users to calculate aerodynamic properties
    of canopies for wind climate modelling, such as canopy roughness and zero 
    plane displacement. Detailed descriptions of both the roughness and the 
    single-tree methods can be found in: Hale, S.E., Gardiner, B., Peace, A., 
    Nicoll, B., Taylor, P. and Pizzirani, S., 2015. Comparison and validation of 
    three versions of a forest wind risk model. Environmental Modelling & 
    Software, 68, pp.27-41. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2015.01.016
