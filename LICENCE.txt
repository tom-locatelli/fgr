Without limiting other conditions in the License, the grant of rights under the License will not include, and the License does not grant to you, the right to Sell the Software.

For purposes of the foregoing, “Sell” means practicing any or all of the rights granted to you under the License to provide to third parties, for a fee or other consideration (including without limitation fees for hosting or consulting/ support services related to the Software), a product or service whose value derives, entirely or substantially, from the functionality of the Software.

Additional Clarifications: 

The Software can be used freely for personal, academic, or non-commercial purposes.

However, for any publication relating to work done with ForestGALES, the Licensor and the package developers would like the opportunity to comment on the paper before it is published, and to be offered co-authorship for a member of the team within Forest Research.

You may not use the Software, in whole or in part, in support of any commercial product without the express consent of the Licensor.

In virtue of the fact that commercial use of the Software without express consent of the Licensor is forbidden, the Licensor shall not in any circumstances be liable for:
(a) loss of profits, sales, business, or revenue;
(b) business interruption;
(c) loss of anticipated savings;
(d) loss or corruption of data or information;
(e) loss of business opportunity, goodwill or reputation; or
(f) any indirect or consequential loss or damage.

Finally, fgr and ForestGALES are primarily research tools.  At present they are also under development themselves and any results produced are therefore subject to change.
