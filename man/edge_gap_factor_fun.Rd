\usage{
edge_gap_factor_fun(
  spacing,
  equivalent_mean_ht,
  dist_edge,
  gap_size,
  fgr_constants
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spacing}{Mean distance between trees (m).}

\item{equivalent_mean_ht}{Equivalent mean stand height: the level in the stand responsible for most of the momentum absorption (m).}

\item{dist_edge}{Distance of tree from the upwind edge (m).}

\item{gap_size}{Length of the upwind gap (m).}
}
\value{
\code{edge_gap_factor}, the combined effect of edge and gap on the maximum bending moment exerted by the wind on a tree. Used in the tmc method.
}
\description{
Combined effect of gap size and edge effect on maximum bending moment for the single-tree method.
